Linux 64 bit build for both HTML 5 and Native:

== HTML5 setup: *emscripten on debian linux* ==


The default Debian (jessie) version fails due to not having fastcomp
thus we will need to build a version with it enabled

Prerequisite: this will require the Debian version of node.js installed

1) Download https://s3.amazonaws.com/mozilla-games/emscripten/releases/emsdk-portable.tar.gz
2) Extract into its own folder (ideally a directory above your minko install)
3) in that directory run

   `./emsdk update` to fetch the project list
   `./emsdk list` to show the projects list
   `./emsdk install <name>` to install a project (see note)
   `./emsdk activate <name>` to activate a project (see note)
   
   Run update, and list as above, then run install/activate for each of the
   following clang-master-64bit, emscripten-master, clang-master-64bit
4) I also needed to edit ~/.emscripten and change NODE_JS = 'nodejs'
5) TO configure the build the EMSCRIPTEN environment variable must be set to
   this SDK directory: run `export EMSCRIPTEN=$PWD/emscripten/master/`


== HTML Overlay ==

To have the overlay work on linux download and place the files as
described in plugin/html-overlay/lib/linux64/README.txt

== Building ==

After ensuring the EMSCRIPTEN environment variable is set as above

1) run `tool/lin/script/solution_gmake_clang.sh` 
   (optionally solution_gmake_gcc.sh)
2) build `make config=release config=linux64_release -j 5` 
   (the -j5 is the thread count, and ought to be number of CPU cores -1)
   this builds the linux version of the engine
3) build `make config=release config=html5_release -j 5`
   this one builds the html5 version
